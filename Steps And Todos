Bugs and fixes

- fix calendar
- optimze input field
- optimze calendar
- add content to home
- fix user screen
- add search functionality
- add filtering functionality
- make code optimize

here are the logics and my thought process of doing filtering

- on a specific date range i have to some some users
- within those users i have to filter out active, super active and border users
- and i will define the status of users based on the amount of meal that those users have.
- more than 10 will consider as super active
- less then 5 consider as active
- and border who are not active in specific peroid but active in peceding peroid

questions

- what is preceding peroid

- 1st
  > > get the date ranges (starting to ending - by using input field calendar) | can be an array of date
- 2nd
  > > map through the users array
  > > get the meal or dateToDayid of all users
  > > based on the search input date ranges get the date id from dateToDayId
  > > then filter out the specific users that matches with the daysWithDetails id with dateToDayID
- 3rd

  > > now the users that we get on those date range (dateToDayId)
  > > we will calculate the length of meals that they take on different dates
  > > based on the amount of numbers so the output
